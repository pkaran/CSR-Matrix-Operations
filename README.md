# CSR-Matrix-Operations

This program supports the following operations:
1. Store a matrix in Compressed Row Storage (CRS) format
2. Perform matrix (in CSR format) times a vector resulting in a matrix in CSR format
3. Perform matrix (in CSR format) times matrix (in CSR format) resulting in a matrix in CSR format
4. Find transpose of a matrix in CSR format

An iterative GMRES algorithm with restart is also implemented to help find the numerical solution of a sparse nonsymmetric system of linear equations.

Please take a look at "Final Project Report.pdf" file for a detailed description of the project.
